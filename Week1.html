    <h3>How Frontend and Backend work together</h3>
    <p>The  frontend is what you see and Interact with on Your screen.
        It sends messages to the backend which is like a brain that processes the information.
        The backend then send messages back to the frontend, which uppdate the screen for you to see.
        They Work together to give a good user experience.
